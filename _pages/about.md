## Research interests

- Bayesian inference
- Variational approximation
- Numerical methods and statistical learning computation


Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for developing a wide range of models, such as hierarchical and nonparametric models. It also provides a set of powerful tools for quantifying uncertainty. Exact inference techniques such as the massage-passing algorithm are extremely challenging in the case of large data sets and complicated posterior densities. Alternatively, approximate inference techniques offer an efficient solution by estimating the intractable posterior densities. In this context, I am particularly interested in robust generalised Bayesian inference, variational methods and computational strategies for intractable problems.
