# Projects/Training

- Expectation propagation in linear regression models
  - *Sep 2021 -*
  - Research training. Learn the basics of variational methods, including VB (MFVB and FFVB) and EP (parallel EP, AEP, SEP and α-EP) methods. Compare different variational methods in linear regression model. Explore the algorithm design with different problem-specific convariance constraints.
- Modeling soccer scores by integrated nested Laplace approximation
  - *Feb 2021 - Aug 2021*
  - Master’s dissertation. Explore the basic ideas of INLA, and implement several models of increasing complexity for predicting the outcomes of soccer matches.
