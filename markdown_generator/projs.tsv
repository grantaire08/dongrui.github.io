Review of “New error bounds for deep ReLU networks using sparse grids” 	Course project	proj05	"University of Edinburgh, School of Mathematics"		2021-03	http://grantaire08.github.io/files/rscam_review.pdf	"This is a paper aims to address the problem, why and when deep networks can lessen or break the curse of dimensionality. Instead of focusing on a particular set of functions which have a very special structure, they consider functions in the Korobov spaces which is more general for high dimensional multivariate approximation."
