Compare different variational methods in linear regression model. Explore the algorithm design with different problem-specific convariance constraints."
Modeling soccer scores by integrated nested Laplace approximation	Master dissertation	proj02	"University of Edinburgh, School of Mathematics"	Feb 2021-Aug 2021	http://grantaire08.github.io/files/MSSbyINLA.pdf	"Explore the basic ideas of INLA, and implement several models of increasing complexity for predicting the outcomes of soccer matches."
Review of “New error bounds for deep ReLU networks using sparse grids” 	Course project	proj03	"University of Edinburgh, School of Mathematics"	Mar 21	http://grantaire08.github.io/files/rscam_review.pdf	"This is a paper aims to address the problem, why and when deep networks can lessen or break the curse of dimensionality. Instead of focusing on a particular set of functions which have a very special structure, they consider functions in the Korobov spaces which is more general for high dimensional multivariate approximation."
